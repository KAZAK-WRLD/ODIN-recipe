    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p1>This hearty grain salad with browned sausage, carrots, and butternut squash is tossed with quinoa for a delicious all-in-one meal.</p1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup uncooked quinoa</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>6 links Dietz & Watson Buffalo Chicken Sausage, cut into chunks</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 cups butternut squash, cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded carrot</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 medium red bell pepper, diced</li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the quinoa and chicken broth in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat 
            to low, cover and simmer until the liquid is absorbed, 12 to 15 minutes. Fluff with a fork.</li>
        <li>While quinoa cooks, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook,
             stirring occasionally, until browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer sausage to a plate.</li>
        <li>Add another tablespoon oil to pan, then add the onion and cook until softened, about 3 minutes.
             Add the squash and carrots and cook about 5 minutes, until the vegetables are tender-firm.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, remaining oil, cumin, salt and black pepper. Add quinoa, sausage, squash-carrot and onion mixture and mix. 
            Chill in the refrigerator at least 30 minutes or up to two days. When ready to serve, stir in the parsley.</li>
    </ol>
